 These are the features of the password manager
 
 ### Storing password
 When a pasword (site key) is stored it is associated with a username (any string), a password (any string) and a website/name of the service to which the site key is meant.
 All this is encrypted and stored locally on your own machine without ever touching the internet.
 
 ### Generating password
 The password manager allows for the generation of new passwords, these can be selected to include numbers and or special characters. Furthermore, you set the length of your desired password.
 Once generated the password is kept in the generate tab until the generator settings are changed or the refresh button is pressed.
 A generated password can be copied by simply clicking the 'copy to clipboard' button.
 
 
 ### Locking
 The password manager contains a button to lock up the application requiring the user to login again. This is to avoid the need of closing the password manager once unattended.
